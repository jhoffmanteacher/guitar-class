## Open work

- [~] **Real-guitar retest of the mic features** (Jonathan, 2026-07-12) —
      **Listening Coach chord check ("Check my changes"): DONE & verified**
      on real guitar (pushed through `2e3feee`). Root cause was NOT the
      onset/verdict knobs but the pitch detector: YIN's strict 0.22 clarity
      gate rejected polyphonic chord frames outright (most strums logged 0
      pitch reads). Fixes now live: forgiving *check-flow* onset thresholds
      (`CHK_*` at the top of coach.js, shared by the Coach + Change Up, split
      from the stricter `COACH_*` the rhythm games keep); chord-mode YIN
      clarity of 0.55 (melody stays 0.22); 20%-ok chord-tone bar; wider
      ±0.18-beat "on the beat" window; same 0.55 clarity applied to Change
      Up. Final real-guitar run: ~4.7 reads/strum, ~65–80% on chord, 87% →
      "Great". Debug meter (`?ccdebug=1`) was used to find this and has been
      stripped. **Still to retest:** a melody check (Module 4 Pattern 1),
      one Note Hunt round, one full Change Up round.
- [x] **Gate the Sets in each module — do them in order** (Jonathan, 2026-07-12) —
      DONE & browser-verified. Every Set now locks until the Set before it is
      finished (all its skills marked "I've got it!" — same bar as Module
      Review). Implementation in `app.js`: `isSetComplete(w)` / `isSetLocked(w)`
      (sequential, first set always open); `renderPills` uses them and gives a
      locked pill a 🔒 + a tap-hint `gateToast(...)` naming the set to finish
      first; `activateSet` has a backstop that refuses a locked set; `goToSet`
      /search deep-links (`gatedJumpGuard`) land on the module's *frontier* set
      with a toast instead of revealing a hidden locked panel; `onModuleChange`
      picks the frontier (first unlocked+unfinished) as its default target and
      never lands on a locked set. CSS: `.wpill.locked:not(.review-pill)::before`
      lock icon + `#gate-toast`. Unlocks live because `toggleSkill` re-renders
      pills. Verified: M4 Set 2/3 locked, tap-toast, live-unlock of Set 2 on
      completing Set 1, Set 3 staying locked.
- [x] **Fix where each page opens (scroll position)** (Jonathan, 2026-07-12) —
      DONE & browser-verified. `activateSet` is now the single authority on set
      scroll: it saves `window.scrollY` for the set you're leaving into an
      in-memory `setScrollPos` map and restores it when you return, or scrolls to
      top for a set never opened this session. Removed the competing
      `window.scrollTo({top:0})` calls in `goToSet`, `songHubGoModule`, and
      `searchGoSet` that were forcing top and causing the "sometimes scrolled,
      sometimes not" inconsistency. Verified: first open → top(0); leave at 500 →
      return restores 500; second set restores its own 300.
- [x] **Harden the gate + scroll** (Jonathan, 2026-07-12, worktree `worktree-jh-session`) —
      Two follow-ups to the two items above, browser-verified. (1) **Previewer
      bypass:** new `isGatePreviewer()` (dev-bypass user via `isDevBypassUser()`,
      or a login as `TEACHER_EMAIL`) makes `isSetLocked` and `isModuleReviewLocked`
      return unlocked, so a teacher/dev previewing the *student* app sees every
      Set + Module Review without grinding skills; the static `locked/comingSoon`
      flag still hides unbuilt content for everyone. Normal students are
      unaffected (verified: student ctx still gates m4 Set 2/3 + review).
      (2) **Scroll survives reload:** `setScrollPos` now hydrates from / persists
      to `localStorage['gc-scroll']` (same `gc-` convention as gc-lastSet), saved
      on set-leave and on `pagehide`/`visibilitychange:hidden`; `window.scrollTo`
      clamps so a stale offset can't overscroll. Verified: reload → m4w2 restored
      to 250, a never-opened set still opens at top. Not pushed yet.
- [ ] **Research backlog (medium/low)** — stored One-Minute-Changes
      scores, tempo-ladder playSeq, Song Journey anatomy sections, bends,
      7th/sus chord color, songwriting capstone, Choice-song style lanes,
      motivation layer. Details in `archive/RESEARCH_UPGRADES.md`; do not
      start without Jonathan's go-ahead.

## Recently shipped (post-archive)

- [x] **Fret Zap** — games arcade, `fz*` in `coach.js` — pushed `c64ef08`
      (2026-07-11), browser-verified against the live code 2026-07-12. A
      no-mic, no-guitar fretboard note-naming sprint: a blank dot lights on
      a fretboard diagram (reuses app.js `localNoteSvg`) and the student
      taps the note's name from four choices before a 60-second clock runs
      out. Mirrors the Chord Blitz scaffolding — streak multiplier,
      wrong-answer reveal + requeue, session best (`fzBest:<deck>`) and
      cross-session best via `games.fz`. Four difficulty decks (low-string
      naturals → all strings 0–5 → naturals to 12 → everything with sharps);
      keys 1–4 answer on a laptop; reward tone via `playNote`. Built with a
      build → adversarial-review (4 dimensions) → verify → fix workflow (4
      findings fixed: a missing `#fz-body` width rule, two changelog idioms,
      an unglossed "naturals"). Browser test confirmed note-math, scoring,
      wrong-answer requeue, keyboard, timer, done screen, and exit cleanup
      (no leaked timer/listener) with zero console errors. **No real-guitar
      retest needed** (it never touches the mic).

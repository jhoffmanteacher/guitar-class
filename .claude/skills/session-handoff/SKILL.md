description: Which kind of cloud session can push (web vs Cowork), the patch-pair zip handoff with APPLY-<name>.md, the sw.js CACHE_VERSION conflict rule, and how the Stop hook and git hooks work. Read before planning a handoff from a cloud session or when a hook misbehaves.
---

**There are two kinds of cloud session and only one of them can push.** Work
out which one you're in before planning a handoff: the old blanket "cloud
can't push" rule was written for Cowork and would send a web session into a
patch-pair handoff it doesn't need.

- **Claude Code on the web pushes normally.** It runs in its own ephemeral
  container with a writable clone and authenticated HTTPS to `origin`, so the
  ordinary "push to GitHub" workflow applies, `main` included. Three limits:
  there is no `gh` CLI (use the GitHub MCP tools instead); the sandbox proxy
  blocks the live site, so `checks.mjs --live` comes back HTTP 403 — the
  deploy has to be confirmed from a local machine; and **the credentials push
  commits but cannot delete refs**, so branch cleanup is a local job. A
  `git push origin --delete` fails with a bare `RPC failed; HTTP 403` from
  GitHub itself, and the GitHub MCP server has `create_branch` but no
  delete-branch tool — there is no way around it from a web session, so hand
  Jonathan the command (or the repo's Branches page) instead of retrying.
  (Pushing verified 2026-09-04, shipping the Journey tab-card restyle; the
  delete limit 2026-09-09, cleaning up six merged branches.)
- **Cowork sessions can't push** — GitHub access is read-only and git writes
  through the device-bridge folder fail on lock files. Never attempt them.
  Instead: run full `node tools/checks.mjs`, commit, `git format-patch`, and
  ship **every patch as a pair with its own `APPLY-<name>.md`** stating the
  base commit, apply order, and steps (`git status` → `git am` → `checks.mjs
  --check --skip-links` → `git push` → `checks.mjs --live`). Afterwards,
  hard-reset the cloud clone to origin — never re-merge.

  **Deliver the pair as ONE zip** (Jonathan, 2026-10-05: "package multiple
  files as zips in the future"). Any handoff of two or more files — a patch
  and its `APPLY-<name>.md`, several patches, any other set — goes out as a
  single `<name>.zip`, never as separate attachments. A single file is sent
  as it is. The one exception is the phone workflow, which stays one plain
  `CHANGES.md`.

  **Applying a patch: a conflict on `sw.js`'s `CACHE_VERSION` line is
  expected, not a problem.** That line is a fingerprint of every cached
  file, so every patch touches it, and it conflicts whenever `main` moved
  between cutting the patch and applying it (Windows line endings make it
  likelier). Keep either side of that one line, finish the `git am`, then
  run the FULL `node tools/checks.mjs` once (not `--check`) to recompute it
  and commit the one-line change before pushing. Don't stop to ask. Any
  conflict in another file is a real conflict — stop and report it.
  (2026-09-24: the Watchtower/Modules 4–6 pair landed this way, `69ac805`.)

**Stop hook (2026-10-25).** `.claude/settings.json` runs
`.claude/hooks/stop-checks.mjs` whenever Claude finishes a turn. If code files
are changed (`.js .mjs .css .html .json`, outside `.claude/` and `audio/`) and
the working-tree state differs from the last one it checked, it runs
`node tools/checks.mjs --check --skip-links` (about 10 s). A real failure
**blocks the stop** and sends the output back, so you fix it in the same turn.
**If it blocks, fix the cause — never loosen a check or add an allowlist entry.**
The expected "shell cache stale" / "audio cache stale" lines are ignored (only
the full `node tools/checks.mjs` before a push recomputes them). It gives up
after 3 tries per turn, never re-blocks the same file state, and fails open on
any internal error. Off switch: `GC_STOP_CHECKS=0` in the environment. It does
not replace the git hooks, the full checks run, or `tools/smoke.mjs`. On
Windows, Git Bash may not have `node` on PATH; the hook then silently doesn't
run (a non-blocking error) and the git hooks remain the gate.

A tracked pre-commit hook at `.githooks/pre-commit` runs the fast offline checks
on every commit. Per-machine setup, once: `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`
— **done on both machines**. Bypass with `--no-verify`.

A second tracked hook, `.githooks/pre-push`, runs the same fast offline checks
again at push time. Not redundant: **git doesn't run `pre-commit` on merge
commits at all**, so a merge can carry a stale `sw.js` past every per-commit
check — on 2026-08-20 one reached `main` that way. Pre-push is the last moment
anything is still local. Both hooks skip the network; the full
`node tools/checks.mjs` is still the real gate.

Both hooks resolve `node` themselves rather than trusting PATH: on Windows they
run under Git Bash, which doesn't inherit the PATH entry the Node installer
adds for cmd/PowerShell, so `pre-commit` fell through to its "skipping checks"
warning on every commit while looking installed (fixed 2026-08-20). If you ever
see that warning, the hook is a no-op — run `node tools/checks.mjs` by hand.
Keep the candidate-path list identical in both hooks.
